# Chapter 6

In this Chapter, we use **Fourier transforms** to propagate light---using the Hedgehog equation (or angular spectrum method) or to calculate Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction patterns in a particular plane. The specific examples include: Fraunhofer diffraction for aperatures 
with the shape of letters.

Note that there are many python based diffraction simulators online, e.g.



https://opticspy.github.io/lightpipes/


https://github.com/rafael-fuente/diffractsim

https://diffractio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Our goal is to provide relatively simple code blocks to
assist the interested reader of **Opticsf2f** in writing their own 
simulations of the topics covered.
